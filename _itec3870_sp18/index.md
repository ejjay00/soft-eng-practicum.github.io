  description: "GGCMaps aims to better, as well as ease, the experience of students at GGC when trying to find various locations across campus. It allows users to search rooms and have them be highlighted on an interactive map for easier meetups, less time wasted finding that one classroom for the first time, and easier navigation across campus for guests. This project was started by Mike Deiters et al, in Fall of 2016. It has since been picked up for continuation by David Rivera et al, to further develop its features, and fix bugs as our Software Development II project. This is the latest update to this project for adding a GGC logo, nearby building cues, new UI controls, and clickable parking lots."

These projects were developed during the ITEC 3870 Software
Development 2 course taught by [Dr. Cengiz Gunay][gunay-ggc] in the
Spring 2018 semester by [Georgia Gwinnett College][ggc] students. Each
project was commissioned and supervised by a GGC professor who
provided the idea, requirements, and direction throughout the
semester. Final products were demonstrated and tested by other
students and faculty at the [GGC CREATE symposium][create] on April 26th. Click on
titles to see their demo sites.
